# Business Objective
Which category of bank services (Loans, Credit Services, Bank Services, Debt Collection, or Other) has the highest volume of complaints, and how does the distribution of complaints across dates and states reveal patterns or trends in customer dissatisfaction over time and geographically?

# Recommendations & Next Steps
Credit services saw over a 200% increase in complaints from 2012 to 2015. Since credit cervices increasing at a faster rate than the rest of the categories, more focus needs to be put on the root causes for these complaints. Solutions to these complaints could come from an information email to customers on general credit information, or dedicating a customer service page directly to credit complaints to counter the increasing influx of credit complaints. Since over 70% of complaints were submitted via the web, live support chat or AI assistant may prove to be beneficial to address customer complaints.
